# LlamaServerClientSharp

A C# client interface for [`llama-server`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/server/README.md), llama.cpp's HTTP server.

# Under construction

This project is at a very early stage of development, and not all of the APIs are currently implemented.

No support will be provided until the basic work has been completed.

If you want to try this project right now, the most recommended way is to just copy the `LlamaClient.cs` and `LlamaClientStructs.cs` files directly into your project. You can see how to use them in the `Program.cs` file.
